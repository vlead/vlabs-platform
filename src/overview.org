* Introduction
  Virtual Labs platform is a slew of micro-services collaborating with each
  other while providing a mechanism to author and deliver content of Virtual
  Labs. Lab data service (LDS), content service, experiment service and
  translators make up the core of the platform. Each experiment or a lab has a
  specification detailing the structure of an experiment or a lab and this
  specification is the glue between authored content and delivered content.

  The Vlabs platform design can be found [[./Vlabs-platform-design.png][=here=]]


* Lab Spec
  Based upon an author's requirements, a lab specification is generated, which
  is in a JSON format and passed along to the Translators application. The lab
  specification includes various information about a lab or an experiment

** Experiment Specification
   Experiments are the unit blocks of the Vlabs platform. The experiment
   specification consists of an unique ID, name, a brief overview and the
   various subsections of the experiment. The content type can be either org or
   md format, depending on the requirements of the author.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
{
  "experiment": {
    "id": "e99847",
    "name": "Parallel and distributed processing",
    "overview": "This deals with eliciting how parallel and distributed processing is done",
    "sections": [
      "Introduction",
      "Objective",
      "Tutorial",
      "Illustration",
      "Procedure",
      "Experiment",
      "Observations",
      "Assignment",
      "References"
    ]
  },
  "content-type": "org"
}
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Lab Specification
   A lab is an aggregate of experiments. These experiments can all be created by
   the same author or by different authors as well.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
{
  "lab": {
    "id": "cse02",
    "name": "Computer Programming",
    "overview": "This lab deals with computer programming",
    "sections": [
      {
        "name": "Introduction"
      },
      {
        "experiments": [
          "e100",
          "e200"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "content-type": "org"
}

* Open edX
  Vlabs is currently using Open edX platform as the platform of choice for
  serving the Vlabs content. The structure generators module for Open edX
  contains an automated script that converts a lab specification that is in a
  JSON format file to packaged structured file that is acceptable by the
  Openedx platform.


* Translators Application
  The [[https://github.com/vlead/translators/tree/develop][=Translators=]] module works as a content skeleton generator for a lab
  specification. The Translators app accepts a lab specification through its
  REST interface and interacts with its system through its system interface to
  generate the required structure of the lab or experiment.

  The Translators app also integrates the structure generators module for Open
  edX within itself and hence ensures backward compatibility with the previous
  operating process of the Vlabs platform.

  The Translators app also versions the experiment generated on Github which in
  turn is accessible to the remote author.

** Creating an experiment
   The output of this route is a versioned structure of the experiment pushed
   onto Github that can be accessed by an author.


** Creating an Openedx lab
   The output of this route is a packaged structure of the lab files required
   by openedx


* Lab data service
  The LDS module stores information about the lab and experiment
  specifications. The LDS module also maintains a resource mapping between the
  experiment IDs and their corresponding content.


* HTML resource generator
  This module observes the hooks placed on the experiments and proceed to pull
  the updated experiments and generate new HTML content files. It requests the
  Lab Data Service for a resource map and adds any new resources generated to
  this resource map. This resource map along with the new content is pushed
  onto the content server.


* Content Server
  This server interacts with the web browsers. The web browser send a request
  to the content server and the server responds with the corresponding resource content.
